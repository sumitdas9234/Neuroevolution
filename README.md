# Neuroevolution

[Neuroevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution) is a form of AI that uses Evolutionary Algorithms to generate Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), parameters, topology and rules. It is most commonly applied in artificial life, general game playing and evolutionary robotics. The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning algorithms, which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs. In contrast, neuroevolution requires only a measure of a network's performance at a task.

## Getting Started

To get the above codes up and running, make sure your system supports HTTP Servers like XAMMP, WAMMP, LAMMP or even Simple Python or NodeJS Servers.

#### Clone the Repo

```
$ cd path/to/Clone
$ git clone https://github.com/sumitdas9234/Neuroevolution.git
```

### Creating Servers

#### Python 2.*

```
$ cd path/to/Neuroevolution
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

#### Python 3.*

```
$ cd path/to/Neuroevolution
$ python3 -m http.server
```

#### More Yet to add :)
### Execution

After creating a server, move to the browser and check your [localhost/Flappy-Birds/](http://localhost/Flappy-Birds).
